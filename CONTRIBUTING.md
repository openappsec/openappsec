# open-appsec Contributing Guide
Thank you for your interest in open-appsec. We welcome everyone that wishes to share their knowledge and expertise to enhance and expand the project. 

Read our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to keep our community approachable and respectable.

In this guide we will provide an overview of the various contribution options' guidelines - from reporting or fixing a bug, to suggesting an enhancement.

## Reporting security vulnerabilities

If you've found a vulnerability or a potential vulnerability in open-appsec please let us know at [security-alert@openappsec.io](mailto:security-alert@openappsec.io). We'll send a confirmation email to acknowledge your report within 24 hours, and we'll send an additional email when we've identified the issue positively or negatively.

An internal process will be activated upon determining the validity of a reported security vulnerability, which will end with releasing a fix and deciding on the applicable disclosure actions. The reporter of the issue will receive updates of this process' progress.

## Reporting a bug

**Important - If the bug you wish to report regards a suspicion of a security vulnerability, please refer to the "Reporting security vulnerability" section**

To report a bug, you can either open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/github/docs/issues/new/choose), or, alternatively, [contact us via our open-appsec open source distribution list](mailto:opensource@openappsec.io).

Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

## Contributing a fix to a bug

Please [contact us via our open-appsec open source distribution list](mailto:opensource@openappsec.io) before writing your code. We will want to make sure we understand the boundaries of the proposed fix, that the relevant coding style is clear for the proposed fix's location in the code, and that the proposed contribution is relevant and eligible.

## Proposing an enhancement

Please [suggest your change via our open-appsec open source distribution list](mailto:opensource@openappsec.io) before writing your code. We will contact you to make sure we understand the boundaries of the proposed fix, that the relevant coding style is clear for the proposed fix's location in the code, and that the proposed contribution is relevant and eligible. There may be additional considerations that we would like to discuss with you before implementing the enhancement.

## Open Source documentation issues

For reporting or suggesting a change, of any issue detected in the documentation files of our open source repositories, please use the same guidelines as bug reports/fixes.

# Final Thanks
We value all efforts to read, suggest changes and/or contribute to our open source files. Thank you for your time and efforts.
