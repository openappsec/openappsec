##  By default there's one worker thread per virtual CPU (vCPU) core available on the machine.

## instead of using local storage for local learning (see line above)
## you can also configure central nfs storage by configuring nfs volume (uncomment the relevant section at end of this file)
## use a shared nfs storage which is recommended in redundant deployments (uncomment line below, comment out the line above) 
#     - learning_nfs:/db:z

## example juice-shop backend container (vulnerable webserver, USE ONLY FOR TESTING AND IN LAB ENV)
  juiceshop-backend:
    profiles:
      - juiceshop

    container_name: juiceshop-backend


## advanced configuration: learning_nfs volume for nfs storage in shared_storage container
##
## when configuring nfs storage in shared_storage container configuration above, make sure to also specify learning_nfs volume (see example below for using AWS EFS storage)
##
#volumes:
# learning_nfs:
#   driver: local
#   driver_opts:
#     type: nfs
#     o: addr=fs-abcdef.efs.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com,rw,nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2,noresvport
#     device: ":/"
