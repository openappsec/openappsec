## example juice-shop backend container (vulnerable webserver, USE ONLY FOR TESTING AND IN LAB ENV)
##
## uncomment this block for testing purposes only, make sure to also adjust the nginx.conf file 
## to include a proxy_pass directive forwarding external traffic on e.g. port 80 to the juiceshop-backend container
## you can use the example file available here:
## https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openappsec/openappsec/refs/heads/main/examples/juiceshop/default.conf
## place the file above in {NGINX_CONF_DIR} and uncomment the two lines for creating a volume mount
## in the appsec-nginx service definition
## note that juiceshop container listens on HTTP port 3000 by default
#
# juiceshop-backend:
#   image: bkimminich/juice-shop:latest
#   container_name: juiceshop-backend


## advanced configuration: learning_nfs volume for nfs storage in shared_storage container
##
## when configuring nfs storage in shared_storage container configuration above, make sure to also specify learning_nfs volume (see example below for using AWS EFS storage)

#   learning_nfs:
#     driver: local
#     driver_opts:
#       type: nfs
