PART II – LIMITED HARDWARE WARRANTY

The warranties provided by Check Point in this Limited Hardware Warranty apply only to Hardware Products you purchase for your use, and not for resale. The term “Hardware Product” means a computing device with a specific function and limited configuration ability. The Hardware Product is sold by Check Point for the purpose of executing the specific Check Point Software supplied with it. NOTHING IN THIS STATEMENT OF LIMITED WARRANTY AFFECTS ANY STATUTORY RIGHTS OF CONSUMERS THAT CANNOT BE WAIVED OR LIMITED BY CONTRACT.

1. LIMITED HARDWARE WARRANTY

Check Point warrants that the hardware components of its Hardware Product shall be free from material defects in design, materials, and workmanship and will function, under normal use and circumstances, in accordance with the documentation provided, for a period of one (1) year from the date of activation of the Hardware Product.  If the Hardware Product has not been activated, the warranty will be valid for fifteen (15) months from the date of Check Point’s shipment of the Hardware Product (“Warranty Period”).
 
After the Warranty Period, certain return material authorization (“RMA”) services, as provided by Check Point (which are not covered under this warranty), are available for all Hardware Products pursuant to a purchased and active Check Point support agreement.

Your sole and exclusive remedy, and Check Point’s sole and exclusive liability for defective hardware components, shall be that Check Point, subject to the terms and conditions of this Section 1, and solely upon confirmation of a defect or failure of a hardware component to perform as warranted, shall at its sole option, either repair or replace the nonconforming hardware component or return of the price paid for the Hardware Product. All replacement parts furnished to you under this warranty shall be refurbished and equivalent to new, and shall be warranted as new for the remainder of the original warranty period. If a hardware failure occurs in the first 30 days from the product’s software activation, Check Point will replace it with new part or full unit as may be needed.  All defective parts, which have been replaced, shall become the property of Check Point. All defective parts that have been repaired shall remain Your property. This warranty gives You specific legal rights. You may have other rights that vary from state to state.

2. EXCLUSIONS

The foregoing warranties and remedies shall be void as to any Hardware Products damaged or rendered unserviceable by one or more of the following: (1) improper or inadequate maintenance by anyone other than Check Point or Check Point’s authorized agents, (2) software or interfacing supplied by anyone other than Check Point, (3) modifications, alterations or additions to the Hardware Products by personnel not certified by Check Point or Check Point’s authorized agents to perform such acts, or other unauthorized repair, installation or opening or other causes beyond Check Point's control, (4) unreasonable refusal to agree with engineering change notice programs, (5) negligence by any person other than Check Point or Check Point's authorized agents, (6) misuse, abuse, accident, electrical irregularity, theft, vandalism, fire, water or other peril, (7) damage caused by containment and/or operation outside the environmental specifications for the Hardware Products, (8) alteration or connection of the Hardware Products to other systems, equipment or devices (other than those specifically approved by Check Point) without the prior approval of Check Point, or (9) any use that is inconsistent with the user manual supplied with the Hardware Product.  The warranty period is not extended if Check Point repairs or replaces a warranted product or any parts. Check Point may change the availability of limited hardware warranties, at its discretion, but any changes will not be retroactive.

3. HARDWARE RETURN PROCEDURES

If a Hardware Product or one of its component parts does not function as warranted during the warranty period, and such nonconformance can be verified by Check Point, Check Point, at its election, will provide either return and replacement service or replacement with a refurbished part/unit for the Hardware Product under the type of warranty service Check Point designates for that Hardware Product. A defective Hardware Product or one of its component parts may only be returned to Check Point upon Check Point’s prior written approval. Any such approval shall reference an RMA number issued by an authorized Check Point service representative. To request an RMA number, you or your local Check Point Certified Solution Provider (“CCSP/CSP/ACSP”) must contact Check Point’s Technical Assistance Center (“TAC”) and open a Service Request. You should always register the Hardware Product in your Check Point User Center account. If you do not register the Hardware Product with Check Point, you may be required to present proof of purchase as evidence of your entitlement to warranty service. The Hardware Product’s identification number will be required for all RMA cases. 

Transportation costs, if any, incurred in connection with the return of a defective Hardware Product to Check Point shall be borne by You. Any transportation costs incurred in connection with the redelivery of a repaired or replacement item to You by Check Point shall be borne by Check Point; provided, however, that if Check Point determines, in its sole discretion, that the allegedly defective item is not covered by the terms and conditions of the warranty or that a warranty claim is made after the warranty period, the cost of the repair by Check Point, including all shipping expenses, shall be reimbursed by You.

4. HARDWARE REPLACEMENT PROCEDURES

Check Point will attempt to diagnose and resolve your problem over the phone or web.  Upon determination of the hardware issue is related to a malfunction of one of the Hardware Product components, an RMA process will be initiated by Check Point’s TAC. Check Point’s TAC will either issue a replacement of the faulty part (like Power Supply, Fan, Hard Disk, etc.) or a full Unit Replacement. 

For Warranty Replacement service, it is required that you deliver the faulty unit to a location Check Point designates, and provide courier name and tracking number to Check Point’s TAC. After the Faulty unit is returned to Check Point, Check Point will use commercially reasonable efforts to ship the replacement hardware within seven (7) business days. Actual delivery times may vary depending on Your location. Check Point’s TAC will send the required hardware to the Hardware Product’s physical location, as it appears in your User Center and as verified with You when opening the Support Service Request.

For Hardware Advanced Replacement, support options Standard, Standard Onsite, Premium, and Premium Onsite are available for customers who have purchased the Hardware Product support plan with Check Point.  More information on the Check Point support programs is specified on Check Point’s website.

5. DEAD ON ARRIVAL (DOA)

If a defective Hardware Product covered under warranty fails to operate within thirty (30) days from its activation, but no more than one hundred and twenty (120) days from the date of Check Point’s shipment of the Hardware Product, Check Point will provide expedited replacement of a new unit within two (2) business days from Check Point fulfillment hub, following confirmation of any such failure.
